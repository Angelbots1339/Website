      <p>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition, which was founded in 1992 by Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers. In FRC, each team is given six weeks to design, build, and test a robot to compete in a game designed by FRC. Many of these games include scoring by shooting balls, stacking trash cans, hanging on bars, balancing on beams, and many other tasks. In FRC, students gain insight into a group of engineering industries: manufacturing, mechanical and electrical engingeering, and software design. Additionally FRC provides students with opportunities to apply to a group of scholarships as well as a group of internships with companies like SpaceX or Apple.

      <p>BEST Robotics (Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology) is our annual off-season competition in which the newcomers to the team learn the skills necessary to the FIRSTS competition, and are mentored by the veterans of years before. We implement real-world engineering and design processes while creating the plans and prototypes necessary for our robot. Every year we are given a specific set of goals and challenges for our robot to overcome, and we have six weeks to design and build it. Much like in real-world engineering projects with a deadline, we must overcome many challenges, including major design changes at the last minute and technical issues. We hope to foster interest in robotics with our new students and also show them what the official competition will look like on a smaller scale.
